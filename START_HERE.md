## 🎤 Your 30-Second Elevator Pitch

**Memorize this:**

> "Campus Safety is a full-stack MERN incident reporting platform with real-time geospatial tracking. Students report safety incidents with location, moderators verify them, and admins manage campuses. The key technical achievement is implementing MongoDB's 2dsphere geospatial indexing, which reduced query time from 5 seconds to under 500ms - a 91% performance improvement. The app uses React 19, Express.js, Clerk for authentication, Leaflet for maps, and is deployed on Vercel serverless."

---

## 📊 Key Metrics (Memorize These!)

- **Tech Stack**: MERN + Clerk + Leaflet + AWS S3
- **Performance**: <500ms geospatial queries (was 5s)
- **Code**: ~15,000 lines
- **API Endpoints**: 40+
- **User Roles**: 3 (Student, Moderator, Admin)
- **Security**: Multi-layer (Clerk, RBAC, rate limiting)
- **Deployment**: Vercel serverless
